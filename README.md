# ETL Pipeline for Health Data Processing

This repository contains an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that processes patient and appointment data, standardizes certain fields, de-identifies sensitive information, and uploads the resulting data to a LocalStack S3 bucket. The pipeline also utilizes PySpark to join and display the processed data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the pipeline, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- PyArrow
- Boto3
- PySpark
- LocalStack (for simulating AWS S3)

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas pyarrow boto3 pyspark
```

## Usage

### Setup LocalStack

1. **Run LocalStack** to simulate AWS services. If you haven't set it up, you can use Docker:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 4566:4566 -p 4510-4559:4510-4559 localstack/localstack
   ```

### Prepare Data Files

Ensure you have two CSV files: `patient_data.csv` and `appointment_data.csv` in the same directory as the script. The CSV files should contain the following fields:

- **Patient Data**:
  - `patient_id`
  - `name`
  - `phone_number`
  - `address`

- **Appointment Data**:
  - `patient_id`
  - Other relevant appointment fields.

### Run the ETL Pipeline

To execute the ETL pipeline, run the script as follows:

```bash
python etl_pipeline.py
```

### Logging

The pipeline logs its operations to the console. You can monitor the logs for any errors or warnings that may occur during execution.

## Pipeline Functions

1. **standardize_phone_number(phone)**: Standardizes phone numbers to the format `+1-XXX-XXX-XXXX`.

2. **standardize_address(address)**: Standardizes addresses by converting them to lowercase and removing extra spaces.

3. **hash_sensitive_info(value)**: Hashes sensitive information (like names, addresses, and phone numbers) using SHA-256.

4. **setup_localstack_s3()**: Sets up a connection to LocalStack S3 and creates a bucket named `health-data` if it doesn't already exist.

5. **process_data(patient_file, appointment_file)**: Reads the CSV files, removes duplicates, standardizes fields, and saves the processed data as Parquet files.

6. **upload_to_localstack(s3, parquet_files)**: Uploads the generated Parquet files to the LocalStack S3 bucket.

7. **load_and_join_pyspark()**: Initializes a PySpark session, reads the Parquet files from S3, and performs an inner join on `patient_id`.

8. **main(patient_file, appointment_file)**: Orchestrates the entire ETL process.

## Error Handling

The pipeline includes error handling and logging for various stages to help troubleshoot any issues that arise during execution.
